# Automated-Microbrewery

This is a small hobby/micro brewery based on herms system.
The controller is made of a raspberry pi interfaced whit an arduino. The program runs on codesys, codesys is a  IEC 61131-3 runtime that allows me to use standard plc programing languages. For the temperature sensors i used DS18B20.
The gas burners came from old wrecked gas heaters.
The setup appart of the work i spend has a good price/quality value. In all i spent about 800â‚¬ for the hardware.

Here you can see the controler in action
