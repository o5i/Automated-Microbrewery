# Automated-Microbrewery


This is a small hobby/micro brewery based on herms system. i have created for friends.
The setup appart of the work i spend has a good price/quality value. 
In all i spent about 800€ for the hardware.
The controller is made of a raspberry pi (debian linux) interfaced whit a Teensy (Arduino based Microcontroller). 
The program runs on codesys, codesys is a  IEC 61131-3 runtime that allows me to use standard plc programing languages. 
I decided to use the pi because it is possible to interface whit a lot of cheap hardware like the multitouch screen.
The other point is that you have access to the network/internet and you can implement a webinterface or other remote management.
The controller box is made from lasercutted wood.
The gas burners came from old wrecked gas heaters.




Here you can see the controler in action:
