# Automated-Microbrewery

This is a small hobby/micro brewery based on herms system. You find some infos about in the files.
I decided to use a raspberry pi as controller because it can interface a lot of hardware and its cheap. 
The program runs on codesys, codesys is a  IEC 61131-3 runtime that allows me to use standard plc programing languages.
The gas burners came from old wrecked gas heaters.
The setup appart of the work i spend has a good price/quality value. In all i spent about 800â‚¬ for the hardware.

Here you can see it in action
