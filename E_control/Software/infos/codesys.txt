Hi,

Target Visu is not supported you could use 
Chromium in kioks mode, this is then like fullscreen targetvisu:
How to archive this?
You need to install the following:

1. Install chromium, x11-xserver-utils and unclutter

sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install chromium x11-xserver-utils unclutter

2. We need to prevent screen from going blank and disable screen saver.
– edit /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart and comment # screen saver line and add those lines:

@xset s off
@xset -dpms
@xset s noblank
@chromium --kiosk --incognito http://localhost:8080/webvisu.htm

another option would be to use a Pi2 and use the Empipany Browser which is installed on Raspian Wheezy.
Pi 2 is needed because on the old Pi's (all others except Pi 2 ) this browser does not work with the plc webvisu.

option --enable-viewport
