.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
The two serial protocol flavours are implemented in the \fBMbusRtuMasterProtocol\fP and \fBMbusAsciiMasterProtocol\fP class. These classes provide functions to open and to close serial port as well as data and control functions which can be used at any time after a protocol has been opened. The data and control functions are organized different conformance classes. For a more detailed description of the data and control functions see section \fBData and Control Functions for all Protocol Flavours\fP.
.PP
Using multiple instances of a \fBMbusRtuMasterProtocol\fP or \fBMbusAsciiMasterProtocol\fP class enables concurrent protocol transfers on multiple COM ports (They should be executed in separate threads).
.PP
See sections \fBThe RTU Protocol\fP and \fBThe ASCII Protocol\fP for some background information about the two serial Modbus protocols.
.PP
See section \fBUsing Serial Protocols\fP for an example how to use the \fBMbusRtuMasterProtocol\fP class.
